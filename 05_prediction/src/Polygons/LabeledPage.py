        A function to take a list of Vertical separators and identify the articles in each image.

        In this version of the code an article is defined as the space spanned between two horizontal
        separators across one or more columns(vertical separators). This means that an article
        could be some combination of the following:

            1. Contained within a given column
            2. Starting in one column and "flowing" into the next until it hits a separator
            3. Starting in a column and being implicitly ended by the end of the page in the last column
                the combination of both of these will force end an article even if no horizontal separator
                was detected.

        See the article class for more info, but a given article can be made up of one or more Boxes which are a series
        of (row,col) coordinates that define rectangle.
